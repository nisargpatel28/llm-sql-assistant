🤖 AI Chatbot for FinTech — Intelligent Transaction Query Assistant

This repository accompanies tutorial
 on building an AI-powered chatbot that integrates RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LangChain to interact with financial data securely and intelligently.

The chatbot connects with your organization’s transactional database to answer natural language queries such as:

💳 “What’s the status of my last transaction?”

📊 “How many transactions were processed today?”

💰 “Show me all transactions above $1,000 last week.”

📈 “What’s the total transaction volume for this month?”
